Nowcasting is weather forecasting on a very short term mesosacle period upto 6 hours. The goal is to give precise and timely prediction of precipitation, storm structure, hail potential, etc. in a local region over a short time period 
(eg., 0-6 hours). These predictions are useful for producing rainfall, storms, hails, etc alerts, providing weather guidance for airports, etc.

Weather Radarâ€™s reflexivity is used by scientists to detect precipitation, evaluate storm structure, determine hail potential, etc. Sequence of radar reflexivity over a region for some time duration has spatiotemporal nature. Weather nowcasting is a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem with the sequence of past reflexivity maps as input and the
sequence of future reflexivity maps as output.

The LSTM encoder-decoder framework provides a general framework for sequence-to-sequence learning problems. I have implemented Convolutional LSTM Encoder-Decoder Network for weather forecasting with the sequences being maps of 
radar reflexivity.
