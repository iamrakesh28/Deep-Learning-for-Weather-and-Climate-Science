# NEXRAD
Will be updated ...
The Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) system currently comprises 160 sites throughout the United States and select overseas locations.
NEXRAD detects precipitation and atmospheric movement or wind. It returns data which when processed can be displayed in a mosaic map which 
shows patterns of precipitation and its movement. The NCEI archive includes the base data, called Level-II, and the derived products, 
called Level-III. Level-II data include the original three meteorological base data quantities: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and 
spectrum width, as well as the dual-polarization base data of differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and differential phase.

Radar Data can be accessed at [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nexradinv/]. There are different ways to access the data. For eg., Data can accessed 
by Single Site and Day, Multiple Sites and Days, etc.
